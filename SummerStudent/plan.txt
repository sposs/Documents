The linear collider community uses the WHIZARD physics generator to 
create the physics events needed to assess the detectors performances.
The generator was recently updated from version 1 to version 2.
The aim of the summer student project is to ensure the compatibility 
of the two versions, ensuring the validity of the subsequent analyses.
