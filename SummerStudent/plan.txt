The linear collider community uses the WHIZARD physics generator to 
create the physics events needed to assess the detector performances.
The generator was recently updated from version 1.97 to version 2.06.
The aim of the summer student is to ensure the compatibility of the two 
versions, ensuring the validity of the subsequent analyses.
