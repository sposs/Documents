\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction}
Production ``nearly'' done, check usual pages for status
\end{frame}

\section{Problems}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Current problems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \alert{Productions stalled}
  \item Access to \alert{data} is limiting the efficiency
  \item \alert{Overlay problems} are also affecting the efficiency

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Data access}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Data specific problems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Disk at CERN \alert{nearly full} (10.6\% free)
  \item Garbage collector started ``cleanup'': remove from disk ``old'' files
  \item Some input files were processed a while back and are considered ``old''
  \item Consequence: need \alert{staging of many files}, but fight against
  garbage collector
  \item Many files fail to be obtained and jobs fail
\end{itemize}
Solution: have many replicas (2 at least, but more is better). Replication
system in DIRAC is useful but buggy: need to hack the DB by hand to make it work, need
some time to look into it.
\end{frame}
\section{Overlay related problems}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Overlay problems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Overlay at 500GeV are killing every thing: 1 file per event, 50 even per
  job $\to$ 50 files: too much for the disks
  \item Need to \alert{merge} them (started this morning)
  \item Need to know how many jobs are running at each site: limit number of
  concurrent access
  \item JobManager of DIRAC could do the job: but service flooded and lost
  efficiency
  \item Designed and implemented dedicated service that tells a job is it can
  proceed (1 night shift).
  \item Getting files do not use CPU: while doing so, jobs can be identified as
  stalled and are killed. $\to$ Need to use CPU time (count to 50e6 for the
  moment).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Other Problems}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Other problems}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Log files are filling up our server: do we need them? Ordered disk
  server, should be available in August
  \item \alert{Data validation} should be done in a more systematic way: use
  Tomato!
  \item Metadata in the catalog is not sufficient: add cross section, mother
  prodution, software packages, etc.
  \item Productions were archived: could not be extended anymore, needed to
  create new ones (3 prods every time)
  \item Interface to create productions a bit cumbersome: student coming in
  August to implement better interface
  \item Applications need testing before being used in production: adds some
  delay
  \item Need automatic merging of DSTs.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Changes in methodology}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Changes in methodology}
Application handling:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Big change: use shared area where possible
  \item Put there also the steering files needed (considered as an
  application in dirac)
  \item Implies tools to install and remove the apps (1 night work\ldots)
\end{itemize}
Data handling:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use stager in DIRAC as much as possible
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{The future}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What about the future}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Having so many samples is a management nightmare: think about having a
  large but unique inclusive background sample
  \item Overlay: is it really needed for the background? 
  \item Need more data validation: individual WG should check the data as soon
  as it comes out, avoid to have to reproduce large samples at the last minute
  \item Complete review of data model: where do we store things, how do we
  access them (will request more storage at CERN, but that's not a long term
  solution)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\section{Conclusion}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Many problems remain
  \item Data access is the biggest issue
  \item Overlay is still an issue
  \item Some last minute hacks were needed to proceed: major changes of strategy
  were needed\\~\\
  \item Most productions very well advanced
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
